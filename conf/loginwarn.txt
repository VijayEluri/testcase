    You are accessing this web application on my development/test server. Because this server is also being used 
    for development and testing of other applications, it may be brought down without warning.  Although that does 
    tend to occur later in the day, it could also happen at other times.  Since this server may occasionally be 
    accessible to the outside world, user login is required.  By using this server, you consent to the following 
    conditions:</P>
  <ul>
    <li><P class='Blurb'>Communications occurring on this server may be monitored.</P></li>
    <li><P class='Blurb'>At any time, data stored on this server may be inspected.</P></li>
    <li><P class='Blurb'>Security protections may be utilized on this server.  Those protections 
         are not provided for your benefit or privacy and may be modified at my discretion.</P></li>
